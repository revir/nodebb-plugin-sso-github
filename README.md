# NodeBB GitHub SSO

Used by [pnlpal](https://pnlpal.dev).

**Notice**: this package will be archived as soon as the original [sso-github] merges it.

Fixed a few problems of the original [sso-github]:

1. fetch non-public github emails.
2. fetch user's github avatar.
3. add setting of trusting user's github email or not.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-sso-github2
